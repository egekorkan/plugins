## Philips Philips HUE Dimmer Switch

This is a TD of a dimmer switch that connects to a Philips Philips HUE Bridge and that can be used to turn on and off different Philips HUE Lights.

### Get it running

- Follow the Philips Philips HUE in-app guide to get your bridge started.
- Follow the [developer page](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/) to get an API Key
- The base URI is using our API Key and Sensor number, replace them with yours:
  - Look for the base URI in the TD
  - Replace the part between `/api/` and `/sensors/` with your API key.
  - This TD is representing the sensor number 2. You should replace the part after `/sensors/` with your sensor's number.
  - This TD uses `Philips-hue` as hostname, in case you have multiple Philips HUE Bridges, you will need to change this in the base URI as well
