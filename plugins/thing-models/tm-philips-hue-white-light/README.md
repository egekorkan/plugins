## Philips Philips HUE Lights

This is a TD of a light bulb that connects to a Philips Philips HUE Bridge.

### Get it running

- Follow the Philips Philips HUE in-app guide to get your bridge started.
- Follow the [developer page](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/) to get an API Key
- The base URI is using our API Key and Light number, replace them with yours:
  - Look for the base URI in the TD
  - Replace the part between `/api/` and `/lights/` with your API key.
  - This TD is representing light number 1. You should replace the part after `/lights/` with your light's number.
  - This TD uses `Philips-hue` as hostname, in case you have multiple Philips HUE Bridges, you will need to change this in the base URI as well
